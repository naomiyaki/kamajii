Kamajii 2019 is a starter kit that was forked after being built to start up another app. The configuration is ready to go for React with SCSS, and DevTool Extensions with support for Mac and Windows.

I saved Kamajii out on their own in case I need to start from here again - if you're making an Electron app with React, they might save you some time too!  
It's basically Snjoo's [parcel-react-electron](https://github.com/Snjoo/parcel-react-electron) updated with the latest [quick start code from Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start), with built a in SCSS starter file (yay [normalize](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css)!) and a little bit of .env file magic to allow configuration of React and Redux Dev Tools on Mac and Windows.

I used "2019" in the name because I think it's important to be very deliberate about the timeline for any kind of boilerplate code (especially JS). As of Fall 2019, it's very up-to-date ðŸŽƒ. If it's a year out or more, it might be time to start fresh with today's modules (or seek out a newer boilerplate).

**That said**, I haven't done any testing to use Kamajii as a starter kit on its own, and I want to add a *little* documentation. It works for me! But please consider this *as is* software for now that requires knowledge of npm/yarn/React and .env files. When I have time, I'll add instructions for how to get started!
